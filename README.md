Job Posting Email Generator using Langchain & Llama 3.1 Model
Overview
This project provides a Job Posting Email Generator that uses state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) tools like the Langchain framework, Llama 3.1 model for response generation, Web Base Loader for data extraction, and Chromadb vector database for portfolio matching.

The system automates the process of extracting relevant details from job postings, matching them with a portfolio using vector similarity, and generating a tailored email for applying to the job.

Features
Job Posting Extraction: Scrape job descriptions from web pages using Langchain's WebBaseLoader.
Portfolio Matching: Use Chromadb to store and query a portfolio, finding the most relevant items based on job skills and experience.
Email Generation: Tailor an email for the job posting using the Llama 3.1 model, incorporating portfolio items that match the job requirements.
Automated Workflow: End-to-end automation of the job application process, including scraping, data extraction, portfolio search, and email drafting.
Tech Stack
Langchain: A framework for managing and chaining language models and components.
Llama 3.1 Model: A language model used for generating responses and content based on prompts.
Langchain WebBaseLoader: A component for scraping job listings from websites.
Chromadb: A persistent vector database used to store and query portfolio data for similarity matching.
Python: The primary programming language used for implementation.
Getting Started
Follow the instructions below to set up the project locally and run the job posting email generator.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Basic understanding of Langchain and NLP
A Groq API key (for using ChatGroq model)
Installation
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-posting-email-generator.git
cd job-posting-email-generator
Install Dependencies
Install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install langchain-groq langchain langchain_community chromadb pandas
API Key
You'll need an API key for Groq’s ChatGroq. To set it up, replace the placeholder in the code with your own key.

python
Copy code
groq_api_key = "your_groq_api_key"
Usage
Scrape Job Posting:

Use Langchain WebBaseLoader to extract job posting data from a given URL.

python
Copy code
from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader

# Replace with your job posting URL
url = "https://jobs.nike.com/job/R-32222?from=job%20search%20funnel"
loader = WebBaseLoader(url)
page_data = loader.load().pop().page_content
Generate Job Description Prompt:

After scraping the job posting, you can pass the data into a PromptTemplate to structure the extraction of specific details such as role, experience, skills, and description.

python
Copy code
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

prompt_extract = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
### SCRAPED TEXT FROM WEBSITE:
{page_data}

### INSTRUCTION:
Extract the following details from the job posting:
- Role
- Experience
- Skills
- Description

Return the extracted data as valid JSON.
""")
Match Portfolio Items:

Using Chromadb, query a vector database containing your portfolio for relevant items based on the extracted skills and experience from the job posting.

python
Copy code
import chromadb
import uuid

# Set up the client and collection
client = chromadb.PersistentClient('vectorstore')
collection = client.get_or_create_collection(name="portfolio")

# Query portfolio items based on job requirements (e.g., Python, React Native)
skills_query = ["Experience in Python", "Expertise in React Native"]
links = collection.query(query_texts=skills_query, n_results=2).get('metadatas', [])
Generate Cold Email:

Combine the job description and relevant portfolio items to generate a customized cold email using the Llama 3.1 model.

python
Copy code
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

prompt_email = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
### JOB DESCRIPTION:
{job_description}

### INSTRUCTION:
Write a cold email to the client explaining how AtliQ can fulfill their job posting requirements. 
Incorporate the following relevant portfolio links to showcase our expertise: {link_list}

Sign off as Mohan, BDE at AtliQ.
""")

# Invoke the email generation process
chain_email = prompt_email | llm
email_response = chain_email.invoke({"job_description": str(job), "link_list": links})
print(email_response.content)
